With increasing height of the melt the convective flow intensifies and eventually even becomes turbulent. As a consequence, the interface becomes rougher but is still coupled to the flow topology. The emerging structure of the interface coincides with the regions of rising hot plumes and descending cold plumes. We find that the roughness amplitude scales with the mean height of the liquid layer. We derive this scaling relation from the Stefan boundary condition and relate it to the non-uniform distribution of heat flux at the interface. For two-dimensional cases, we further quantify the horizontal length scale of the morphology, based on the theoretical upper and lower bounds given for the size of convective cells known from Wang

	abstract = {The presence of salt in seawater strongly affects the melt rate and the shape evolution of ice, both of utmost relevance in ice–ocean interactions and thus for the climate. To get a better quantitative understanding of the physical mechanics at play in ice melting in salty water, we numerically investigate the lateral melting of an ice block in stably stratified saline water. The developing ice shape from our numerical results shows good agreement with the experiments and theory from Huppert \& Turner (
              J. Fluid Mech.
              , vol. 100, 1980, pp. 367–384). Furthermore, we find that the melt rate of ice depends non-monotonically on the mean ambient salinity: it first decreases for increasing salt concentration until a local minimum is attained, and then increases again. This non-monotonic behaviour of the ice melt rate is due to the competition among salinity-driven buoyancy, temperature-driven buoyancy and salinity-induced stratification. We develop a theoretical model based on the force balance which gives a prediction of the salt concentration for which the melt rate is minimal, and is consistent with our data. Our findings give insight into the interplay between phase transitions and double-diffusive convective flows.},

	abstract = {The breakup of coaxial liquid jets in a co-ﬂowing gas stream under the radial thermal ﬁeld is studied by the linear instability theory. A simpliﬁed physical model is established, and an analytical dimensionless dispersion relation for temporally axisymmetric perturbations is derived and solved numerically. The outer liquid-gas surface tension coefﬁcient is assumed to be a linear function of temperature. Due to the radial temperature gradients, the time-dependent spatial variation of surface tension gives rise to a shear stress and induces Marangoni force upon the ﬂow. The effects of different process parameters on the characteristics of unstable modes including the para-sinuous mode and the para-varicose mode are explored. It is found that the para-sinuous mode always dominates the jet instability in the parametric regions and the increasing temperature ratio of the surrounding gas stream and the inner liquid jet (T31) can reduce the maximum growth rates of unstable modes and corresponding dominant wavenumbers. The Reynolds number destabilizes the jet instability, and the Weber number suppresses it at relatively long wavelengths for both isothermal and non-isothermal situations. The Marangoni number and the Peclet number have a destabilizing effect for T31 {\textless} 1, but it is opposite for T31 {\textgreater} 1. These theoretical predictions would provide insight into underlying physical mechanisms of thermal jet breakup and compound droplet formation.},

Streaming {DMD} avoids storing the entire data sequence in memory by approximating the dynamic modes through incremental updates with new available data. In this paper, we use {sDMD} to identify and extract dominant spatiotemporal structures of different turbulent flows, requiring the analysis of large datasets. First, the efficiency and accuracy of {sDMD} are compared to the classical {DMD}, using a publicly available test dataset that consists of velocity field snapshots obtained by direct numerical simulation of a wake flow behind a cylinder. Streaming {DMD} not only reliably reproduces the most important dynamical features of the flow; our calculations also highlight its advantage in terms of the required computational resources. We subsequently use {sDMD} to analyse three different turbulent flows that all show some degree of large-scale coherence: rapidly rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection, horizontal convection and the asymptotic suction boundary layer ({ASBL}). Structures of different frequencies and spatial extent can be clearly separated, and the prominent features of the dynamics are captured with just a few dynamic modes. In summary, we demonstrate that {sDMD} is a powerful tool for the identification of spatiotemporal structures in a wide range of turbulent flows.},

              , vol. 8, 2017, pp. 1–6) showed that the injection velocity of espresso determines the depth of coffee–milk mixture. After a while, when a stable stratification forms in the mixture, the layering process can be modelled as a double diffusive convection system with a stably stratified coffee–milk mixture cooled from the side. More specifically, we perform (two-dimensional) direct numerical simulations of laterally cooled double diffusive convection for a wide parameter range, where the convective flow is driven by a lateral temperature gradient while stabilized by a vertical concentration gradient. Depending on the strength of stabilization as compared to the thermal driving, the system exhibits different flow regimes. When the thermal driving force dominates over the stabilizing force, the flow behaves like vertical convection in which a large-scale circulation develops. However, with increasing strength of the stabilizing force, a meta-stable layered regime emerges. Initially, several vertically-stacked convection rolls develop, and these well-mixed layers are separated by sharp interfaces with large concentration gradients. The initial thickness of these emerging layers can be estimated by balancing the work exerted by thermal driving and the required potential energy to bring fluid out of its equilibrium position in the stably stratified fluid. In the layered regime, we further observe successive layer merging, and eventually only a single convection roll remains. We elucidate the following merging mechanism: as weakened circulation leads to accumulation of hot fluid adjacent to the hot sidewall, larger buoyancy forces associated with hotter fluid eventually break the layer interface. Then two layers merge into a larger layer, and circulation establishes again within the merged structure.},

Often, {CO}2 concentration is used as a proxy for the concentration of bio-aerosols of respiratory droplets, and therefore, tracking the {CO}2 concentration in ventilation strategies can be useful to understand and quantify the risk of spread of communicable respiratory illnesses. At low to moderate airflow rates, the flow in the downflow setup is not mixed, but stratified. The {CO}2 concentration in the upper and lower layers is determined by the strength of the thermal plume originating from the occupant. We provide a simple theoretical model to predict the height of the stratified interface, the volumetric flux of the ascending plume, and the {CO}2 concentration in the lower and upper layers. At very high airflow rates, the flow is well-mixed and the average {CO}2 concentration in the room can be predicted with the mixing ventilation assumption. We demonstrate that at low to moderate airflow rates, displacement ventilation more effectively maintains lower {CO}2 concentrations in the lower layer compared to downflow ventilation.},

              and their spatial distribution. In all cases, asymmetric temperature profiles are observed, which we quantitatively explain based on the heat flux conservation at each horizontal section. We further propose the idea of using an equivalent single-phase set-up to mimic the system with attached bubbles. Based on this equivalence, we can calculate the heat transfer. Without introducing any free parameter, the predictions for the Nusselt number, the upper and lower thermal boundary layer thicknesses and the mean centre temperature agree well with the numerical results.

	abstract = {Iceberg melting is a critical factor for climate change. However, the shape of an iceberg is an often neglected aspect of its melting process. Our study investigates the inﬂuence of different ice shapes and ambient ﬂow velocities on melt rates by conducting direct numerical simulations of a simpliﬁed system of bluff body ﬂow. Our study focuses on the ellipsoidal shape, with the aspect ratio as the control parameter. We found the shape plays a crucial role in the melting process, resulting in signiﬁcant variations in the melt rate between different shapes. Without ﬂow, the optimal shape for a minimal melt rate is the disk (two-dimensional) or sphere (three-dimensional), due to the minimal surface area. However, as the ambient ﬂow velocity increases, the optimal shape changes with the aspect ratio. We ﬁnd that ice with an elliptical shape (when the long axis is aligned with the ﬂow direction) can melt up to 10 \% slower than a circular shape when exposed to ﬂowing water. Following the approach considered by Huang et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 765, 2015, R3) for dissolving bodies, we provide a quantitative theoretical explanation for this optimal shape, based on the combined contributions from both surface-area effects and convective-heat-transfer effects. Our ﬁndings provide insight into the interplay between phase transitions and ambient ﬂows, contributing to our understanding of the iceberg melting process and highlighting the need to consider the aspect-ratio effect in estimates of iceberg melt rates.},

	abstract = {Latent heat storage ({LHS}) has emerged as a promising solution for addressing the challenges of large-scale and long-term energy storage, offering a clean and reusable system. Being in the developmental stage, and with only limited theoretical predictions being available, there is a need to enhance the efficiency of {LHS} systems. In this study, we use numerical simulations to study the melting process of a phase-change material ({PCM}) in a rectangular domain. A significant enhancement in the melt rate of the {PCM} is found by a simple inclination of the domain, with a 60\% increase in melt rate compared to a standard square unit without inclination through enhanced heat transfer. We establish a theoretical relation for the optimal {PCM} melt rate, based on the inclination angle and the domain aspect ratio, outlining the optimal conditions for the {PCM} melt rate, which is solely dependent on the domain geometry. We further propose a heat-transfer model that predicts the optimal aspect ratio for achieving the maximum melt rate as a function of the Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers.

	abstract = {Melting and solidification in periodically time-modulated thermal convection are relevant for numerous natural and engineering systems, for example, glacial melting under periodic sun radiation and latent thermal energy storage under periodically pulsating heating. It is highly relevant for the estimation of melt rate and melt efficiency management. However, even the dynamics of a solid–liquid interface shape subjected to a simple sinusoidal heating has not yet been investigated in detail. In this paper, we offer a better understanding of the modulation frequency dependence of the melting and solidification front. We numerically investigate periodic melting and solidification in turbulent convective flow with the solid above and the melted liquid below, and sinusoidal heating at the bottom plate with the mean temperature equal to the melting temperature. We investigate how the periodic heating can prevent the full solidification, and the resulting flow structures and the quasi-equilibrium interface height. We further study the dependence on the heating modulation frequency. As the frequency decreases, we found two distinct regimes, which are ‘partially solid’ and ‘fully solid’. In the fully solid regime, the liquid freezes completely, and the effect of the modulation is limited. In the partially solid regime, the solid partially melts, and a steady or unsteady solid–liquid interface forms depending on the frequency. The interface height can be derived based on the energy balance through the interface. In the partially solid regime, the interface height oscillates periodically, following the frequency of modulation. Here, we propose a perturbation approach that can predict the dependency of the oscillation amplitude on the modulation frequency.},
