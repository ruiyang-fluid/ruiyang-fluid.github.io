abstract: We numerically investigate turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection with gas
  bubbles attached to the hot plate, mimicking a core feature in electrolysis, catalysis
  or boiling. The existence of bubbles on the plate reduces the global heat transfer
  due to the much lower thermal conductivity of gases as compared with liquids and
  changes the structure of the boundary layers. The numerical simulations are performed
  in three dimensions at Prandtl number    $mboxPr=4.38$   (water) and Rayleigh number    $10textasciicircum7leqslant
  mboxRaleqslant 10textasciicircum8$   . For simplicity, we assume the bubbles to
  be equally sized and having pinned contact lines. We vary the total gas-covered
  area fraction    $0.18 leqslant S_0 leqslant 0.62$   , the relative bubble height    $0.02leqslant
  h/H leqslant 0.05$   (where    $H$   is the height of the Rayleigh–Bénard cell),
  the bubble number    $40 leqslant n leqslant 144$   and their spatial distribution.
  In all cases, asymmetric temperature profiles are observed, which we quantitatively
  explain based on the heat flux conservation at each horizontal section. We further
  propose the idea of using an equivalent single-phase set-up to mimic the system
  with attached bubbles. Based on this equivalence, we can calculate the heat transfer.
  Without introducing any free parameter, the predictions for the Nusselt number,
  the upper and lower thermal boundary layer thicknesses and the mean centre temperature
  agree well with the numerical results. Finally, our predictions also work for the
  cases with much larger    $mboxPr$   (e.g.    $400$   ), which indicates that our
  results can also be applied to predict the mass transfer in water electrolysis with
  bubbles attached to the electrode surface or in catalysis.
