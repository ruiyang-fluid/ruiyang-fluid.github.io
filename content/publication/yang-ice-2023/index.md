abstract: 'The presence of salt in seawater strongly affects the melt rate and the
  shape evolution of ice, both of utmost relevance in ice–ocean interactions and thus
  for the climate. To get a better quantitative understanding of the physical mechanics
  at play in ice melting in salty water, we numerically investigate the lateral melting
  of an ice block in stably stratified saline water. The developing ice shape from
  our numerical results shows good agreement with the experiments and theory from
  Huppert & Turner ( J. Fluid Mech. , vol. 100, 1980, pp. 367–384). Furthermore, we
  find that the melt rate of ice depends non-monotonically on the mean ambient salinity:
  it first decreases for increasing salt concentration until a local minimum is attained,
  and then increases again. This non-monotonic behaviour of the ice melt rate is due
  to the competition among salinity-driven buoyancy, temperature-driven buoyancy and
  salinity-induced stratification. We develop a theoretical model based on the force
  balance which gives a prediction of the salt concentration for which the melt rate
  is minimal, and is consistent with our data. Our findings give insight into the
  interplay between phase transitions and double-diffusive convective flows.'
