 abstract = {Latent heat storage (LHS) has emerged as a promising solution for addressing the challenges of large-scale and long-term energy storage, offering a clean and reusable system. Being in the developmental stage, and with only limited theoretical predictions being available, there is a need to enhance the efficiency of LHS systems. In this study, we use numerical simulations to study the melting process of a phase-change material (PCM) in a rectangular domain. A significant enhancement in the melt rate of the PCM is found by a simple inclination of the domain, with a 60% increase in melt rate compared to a standard square unit without inclination through enhanced heat transfer. We establish a theoretical relation for the optimal PCM melt rate, based on the inclination angle and the domain aspect ratio, outlining the optimal conditions for the PCM melt rate, which is solely dependent on the domain geometry. We further propose a heat-transfer model that predicts the optimal aspect ratio for achieving the maximum melt rate as a function of the Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers.
