abstract: Latent heat storage (LHS) has emerged as a promising solution for addressing
  the challenges of large-scale and long-term energy storage, offering a clean and
  reusable system. Being in the developmental stage, and with only limited theoretical
  predictions being available, there is a need to enhance the efficiency of LHS systems.
  In this study, we use numerical simulations to study the melting process of a phase-change
  material (PCM) in a rectangular domain. A significant enhancement in the melt rate
  of the PCM is found by a simple inclination of the domain, with a 60% increase in
  melt rate compared to a standard square unit without inclination through enhanced
  heat transfer. We establish a theoretical relation for the optimal PCM melt rate,
  based on the inclination angle and the domain aspect ratio, outlining the optimal
  conditions for the PCM melt rate, which is solely dependent on the domain geometry.
  We further propose a heat-transfer model that predicts the optimal aspect ratio
  for achieving the maximum melt rate as a function of the Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers.     Published
