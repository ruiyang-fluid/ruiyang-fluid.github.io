abstract: We numerically study the melting process of a solid layer heated from below
  such that a liquid melt layer develops underneath. The objective is to quantitatively
  describe and understand the emerging topography of the structures (characterized
  by the amplitude and wavelength), which evolve out of an initially smooth surface.
  By performing both two-dimensional (achieving Rayleigh number up to    $Ra=10textasciicircum11$   )
  and three-dimensional (achieving Rayleigh number up to    $Ra=10textasciicircum9$   )
  direct numerical simulations with an advanced finite difference solver coupled to
  the phase-field method, we show how the interface roughness is spontaneously generated
  by thermal convection. With increasing height of the melt the convective flow intensifies
  and eventually even becomes turbulent. As a consequence, the interface becomes rougher
  but is still coupled to the flow topology. The emerging structure of the interface
  coincides with the regions of rising hot plumes and descending cold plumes. We find
  that the roughness amplitude scales with the mean height of the liquid layer. We
  derive this scaling relation from the Stefan boundary condition and relate it to
  the non-uniform distribution of heat flux at the interface. For two-dimensional
  cases, we further quantify the horizontal length scale of the morphology, based
  on the theoretical upper and lower bounds given for the size of convective cells
  known from Wang et al. ( Phys. Rev. Lett. , vol. 125, 2020, 074501). These bounds
  agree with our simulation results. Our findings highlight the key connection between
  the morphology of the melting solid and the convective flow structures in the melt
  beneath.
