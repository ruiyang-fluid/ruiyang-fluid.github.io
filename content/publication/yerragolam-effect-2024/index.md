abstract: We perform direct numerical simulations to study the effect of increasing
  airflow rate on CO2 concentration in downflow and displacement ventilation in a
  room with one occupant. Often, CO2 concentration is used as a proxy for the concentration
  of bio-aerosols of respiratory droplets, and therefore, tracking the CO2 concentration
  in ventilation strategies can be useful to understand and quantify the risk of spread
  of communicable respiratory illnesses. At low to moderate airflow rates, the flow
  in the downflow setup is not mixed, but stratified. The CO2 concentration in the
  upper and lower layers is determined by the strength of the thermal plume originating
  from the occupant. We provide a simple theoretical model to predict the height of
  the stratified interface, the volumetric flux of the ascending plume, and the CO2
  concentration in the lower and upper layers. At very high airflow rates, the flow
  is well-mixed and the average CO2 concentration in the room can be predicted with
  the mixing ventilation assumption. We demonstrate that at low to moderate airflow
  rates, displacement ventilation more effectively maintains lower CO2 concentrations
  in the lower layer compared to downflow ventilation.
