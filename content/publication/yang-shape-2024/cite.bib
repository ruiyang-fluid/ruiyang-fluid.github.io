 abstract = {Iceberg melting is a critical factor for climate change. However, the shape of an iceberg is an often neglected aspect of its melting process. Our study investigates the inﬂuence of different ice shapes and ambient ﬂow velocities on melt rates by conducting direct numerical simulations of a simpliﬁed system of bluff body ﬂow. Our study focuses on the ellipsoidal shape, with the aspect ratio as the control parameter. We found the shape plays a crucial role in the melting process, resulting in signiﬁcant variations in the melt rate between different shapes. Without ﬂow, the optimal shape for a minimal melt rate is the disk (two-dimensional) or sphere (three-dimensional), due to the minimal surface area. However, as the ambient ﬂow velocity increases, the optimal shape changes with the aspect ratio. We ﬁnd that ice with an elliptical shape (when the long axis is aligned with the ﬂow direction) can melt up to 10 % slower than a circular shape when exposed to ﬂowing water. Following the approach considered by Huang et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 765, 2015, R3) for dissolving bodies, we provide a quantitative theoretical explanation for this optimal shape, based on the combined contributions from both surface-area effects and convective-heat-transfer effects. Our ﬁndings provide insight into the interplay between phase transitions and ambient ﬂows, contributing to our understanding of the iceberg melting process and highlighting the need to consider the aspect-ratio effect in estimates of iceberg melt rates.},
