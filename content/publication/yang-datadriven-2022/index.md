abstract: 'Streaming Dynamic Mode Decomposition (sDMD) is a low-storage version of
  dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), a data-driven method to extract spatiotemporal
  flow patterns. Streaming DMD avoids storing the entire data sequence in memory by
  approximating the dynamic modes through incremental updates with new available data.
  In this paper, we use sDMD to identify and extract dominant spatiotemporal structures
  of different turbulent flows, requiring the analysis of large datasets. First, the
  efficiency and accuracy of sDMD are compared to the classical DMD, using a publicly
  available test dataset that consists of velocity field snapshots obtained by direct
  numerical simulation of a wake flow behind a cylinder. Streaming DMD not only reliably
  reproduces the most important dynamical features of the flow; our calculations also
  highlight its advantage in terms of the required computational resources. We subsequently
  use sDMD to analyse three different turbulent flows that all show some degree of
  large-scale coherence: rapidly rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection, horizontal convection
  and the asymptotic suction boundary layer (ASBL). Structures of different frequencies
  and spatial extent can be clearly separated, and the prominent features of the dynamics
  are captured with just a few dynamic modes. In summary, we demonstrate that sDMD
  is a powerful tool for the identification of spatiotemporal structures in a wide
  range of turbulent flows.'
