abstract: Indoor ventilation is essential for a healthy and comfortable living environment.
  A key issue is to discharge anthropogenic air contamination such as CO    $_2$   gas
  or, of potentially more direct consequence, airborne respiratory droplets. Here,
  by employing direct numerical simulations, we study mechanical displacement ventilation
  with a wide range of ventilation rates    $Q$   from 0.01 to 0.1 m    $textasciicircum3$   s    $textasciicircum-1$   person    $textasciicircum-1$   .
  For this ventilation scheme, a cool lower zone is established beneath a warm upper
  zone with interface height    $h$   , which depends on    $Q$   . For weak ventilation,
  we find the scaling relation    $hsim Qtextasciicircum3/5$   , as suggested by Hunt
  & Linden ( Build. Environ. , vol. 34, 1999, pp. 707â€“720). Also, the CO    $_2$   concentration
  decreases with    $Q$   within this regime. However, for too strong ventilation,
  the interface height    $h$   becomes insensitive to    $Q$   , and the ambient
  averaged CO    $_2$   concentration decreases towards the ambient value. At these
  values of    $Q$   , the concentrations of pollutants are very low and so further
  dilution has little effect. We suggest that such scenarios arise when the vertical
  kinetic energy associated with the ventilation flow is significant compared with
  the potential energy of the thermal stratification.
