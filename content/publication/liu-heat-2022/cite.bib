 abstract = {We numerically investigate turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection through two immiscible fluid layers, aiming to understand how the layer thickness and fluid properties affect the heat transfer (characterized by the Nusselt number



\$\mbox \Nu\\$


) in two-layer systems. Both two- and three-dimensional simulations are performed at fixed global Rayleigh number



\$\mbox \Ra\=10\textasciicircum8\$


, Prandtl number



\$\mbox \Pr\=4.38\$


and Weber number



\$\mbox \We\=5\$


. We vary the relative thickness of the upper layer between



\$0.01 \le \alpha \le 0.99\$


and the thermal conductivity coefficient ratio of the two liquids between



\$0.1 \le \lambda _k \le 10\$


. Two flow regimes are observed. In the first regime at



\$0.04\le \alpha \le 0.96\$


, convective flows appear in both layers and



\$\mbox \Nu\\$


is not sensitive to



\$\alpha\$


. In the second regime at



\$\alpha \le 0.02\$


or



\$\alpha \ge 0.98\$


, convective flow only exists in the thicker layer, while the thinner one is dominated by pure conduction. In this regime,



\$\mbox \Nu\\$


is sensitive to



\$\alpha\$


. To predict



\$\mbox \Nu\\$


in the system in which the two layers are separated by a unique interface, we apply the Grossmann–Lohse theory for both individual layers and impose heat flux conservation at the interface. Without introducing any free parameter, the predictions for



\$\mbox \Nu\\$


and for the temperature at the interface agree well with our numerical results and previous experimental data.},
