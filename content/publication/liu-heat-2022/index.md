abstract: We numerically investigate turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection through
  two immiscible fluid layers, aiming to understand how the layer thickness and fluid
  properties affect the heat transfer (characterized by the Nusselt number    $mbox
  Nu$   ) in two-layer systems. Both two- and three-dimensional simulations are performed
  at fixed global Rayleigh number    $mbox Ra=10textasciicircum8$   , Prandtl number    $mbox
  Pr=4.38$   and Weber number    $mbox We=5$   . We vary the relative thickness of
  the upper layer between    $0.01 le alpha le 0.99$   and the thermal conductivity
  coefficient ratio of the two liquids between    $0.1 le lambda _k le 10$   . Two
  flow regimes are observed. In the first regime at    $0.04le alpha le 0.96$   ,
  convective flows appear in both layers and    $mbox Nu$   is not sensitive to    $alpha$   .
  In the second regime at    $alpha le 0.02$   or    $alpha ge 0.98$   , convective
  flow only exists in the thicker layer, while the thinner one is dominated by pure
  conduction. In this regime,    $mbox Nu$   is sensitive to    $alpha$   . To predict    $mbox
  Nu$   in the system in which the two layers are separated by a unique interface,
  we apply the Grossmann–Lohse theory for both individual layers and impose heat flux
  conservation at the interface. Without introducing any free parameter, the predictions
  for    $mbox Nu$   and for the temperature at the interface agree well with our
  numerical results and previous experimental data.
