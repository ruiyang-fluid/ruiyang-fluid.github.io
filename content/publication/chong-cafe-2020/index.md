abstract: 'Abstract      ,   In the preparation of café latte, spectacular layer formation
  can occur between the espresso shot in a glass of milk and the milk itself. Xue
  et al. ( Nat. Commun. , vol. 8, 2017, pp. 1–6) showed that the injection velocity
  of espresso determines the depth of coffee–milk mixture. After a while, when a stable
  stratification forms in the mixture, the layering process can be modelled as a double
  diffusive convection system with a stably stratified coffee–milk mixture cooled
  from the side. More specifically, we perform (two-dimensional) direct numerical
  simulations of laterally cooled double diffusive convection for a wide parameter
  range, where the convective flow is driven by a lateral temperature gradient while
  stabilized by a vertical concentration gradient. Depending on the strength of stabilization
  as compared to the thermal driving, the system exhibits different flow regimes.
  When the thermal driving force dominates over the stabilizing force, the flow behaves
  like vertical convection in which a large-scale circulation develops. However, with
  increasing strength of the stabilizing force, a meta-stable layered regime emerges.
  Initially, several vertically-stacked convection rolls develop, and these well-mixed
  layers are separated by sharp interfaces with large concentration gradients. The
  initial thickness of these emerging layers can be estimated by balancing the work
  exerted by thermal driving and the required potential energy to bring fluid out
  of its equilibrium position in the stably stratified fluid. In the layered regime,
  we further observe successive layer merging, and eventually only a single convection
  roll remains. We elucidate the following merging mechanism: as weakened circulation
  leads to accumulation of hot fluid adjacent to the hot sidewall, larger buoyancy
  forces associated with hotter fluid eventually break the layer interface. Then two
  layers merge into a larger layer, and circulation establishes again within the merged
  structure.'
