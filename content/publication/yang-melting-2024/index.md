abstract: Melting and solidification in periodically time-modulated thermal convection
  are relevant for numerous natural and engineering systems, for example, glacial
  melting under periodic sun radiation and latent thermal energy storage under periodically
  pulsating heating. It is highly relevant for the estimation of melt rate and melt
  efficiency management. However, even the dynamics of a solid–liquid interface shape
  subjected to a simple sinusoidal heating has not yet been investigated in detail.
  In this paper, we offer a better understanding of the modulation frequency dependence
  of the melting and solidification front. We numerically investigate periodic melting
  and solidification in turbulent convective flow with the solid above and the melted
  liquid below, and sinusoidal heating at the bottom plate with the mean temperature
  equal to the melting temperature. We investigate how the periodic heating can prevent
  the full solidification, and the resulting flow structures and the quasi-equilibrium
  interface height. We further study the dependence on the heating modulation frequency.
  As the frequency decreases, we found two distinct regimes, which are ‘partially
  solid’ and ‘fully solid’. In the fully solid regime, the liquid freezes completely,
  and the effect of the modulation is limited. In the partially solid regime, the
  solid partially melts, and a steady or unsteady solid–liquid interface forms depending
  on the frequency. The interface height can be derived based on the energy balance
  through the interface. In the partially solid regime, the interface height oscillates
  periodically, following the frequency of modulation. Here, we propose a perturbation
  approach that can predict the dependency of the oscillation amplitude on the modulation
  frequency.
