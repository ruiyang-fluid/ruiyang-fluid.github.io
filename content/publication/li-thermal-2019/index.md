abstract: The breakup of coaxial liquid jets in a co-ﬂowing gas stream under the radial
  thermal ﬁeld is studied by the linear instability theory. A simpliﬁed physical model
  is established, and an analytical dimensionless dispersion relation for temporally
  axisymmetric perturbations is derived and solved numerically. The outer liquid-gas
  surface tension coefﬁcient is assumed to be a linear function of temperature. Due
  to the radial temperature gradients, the time-dependent spatial variation of surface
  tension gives rise to a shear stress and induces Marangoni force upon the ﬂow. The
  effects of different process parameters on the characteristics of unstable modes
  including the para-sinuous mode and the para-varicose mode are explored. It is found
  that the para-sinuous mode always dominates the jet instability in the parametric
  regions and the increasing temperature ratio of the surrounding gas stream and the
  inner liquid jet (T31) can reduce the maximum growth rates of unstable modes and
  corresponding dominant wavenumbers. The Reynolds number destabilizes the jet instability,
  and the Weber number suppresses it at relatively long wavelengths for both isothermal
  and non-isothermal situations. The Marangoni number and the Peclet number have a
  destabilizing effect for T31 textless 1, but it is opposite for T31 textgreater
  1. These theoretical predictions would provide insight into underlying physical
  mechanisms of thermal jet breakup and compound droplet formation.
